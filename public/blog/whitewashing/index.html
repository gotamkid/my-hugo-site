  <h3 id="a-pragmatic-view-on-western-approach-to-social-and-moral-issues"><strong>A pragmatic view on western approach to social and moral issues</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What is Whitewashing?</strong><br>
To downplay or minimize the negative aspects of a social or moral issue, or to downplay the positive aspects of an issue.</p>
<p><strong>Common Techniques</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Timeline trimming</strong></p>
<p>ever wondered what happened to pollution during industrial revolution?<br>
or why developing countries have to pay to developed countries for establishing industrial bases in their own territories?<br>
Its like that since developed countries decided a particular timeline before that all pollution is ignored.<br>
everyone who started developing later, they have to pay money, after that they can ignore pollution.<br>
something went wrong? just dont account for it. never ever refer to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Its according to rules</strong></p>
<p>everything is rationalised later on and justified by the rules.<br>
there were no failures in the past, so there will be no failures in the future.<br>
its according to the rules of the past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Claim good stuff from other cultures</strong></p>
<p>portray really good things from other cultures as bad<br>
and later reintroduce the same thing as our original.<br>
reject the previous culture and its existance.<br>
build and propagate false narratives to defend and cover up the stealing of culture.<br>
all good stuff always belonged to us. it exists for us only.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Its good, if you are making money out of it,<br>
It is called WHITEwashing for a reason,</p>
<p>&hellip;and thats it for now.</p>
