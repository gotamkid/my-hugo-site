### **A pragmatic view on western approach to social and moral issues**

**What is Whitewashing?**\
To downplay or minimize the negative aspects of a social or moral issue, or to downplay the positive aspects of an issue.

**Common Techniques**:

1. **Timeline trimming**

   ever wondered what happened to pollution during industrial revolution?\
   or why developing countries have to pay to developed countries for establishing industrial bases in their own territories?\
   Its like that since developed countries decided a particular timeline before that all pollution is ignored.\
   everyone who started developing later, they have to pay money, after that they can ignore pollution.\
   something went wrong? just dont account for it. never ever refer to it.

2. **Its according to rules**

   everything is rationalised later on and justified by the rules.\
   there were no failures in the past, so there will be no failures in the future.\
   its according to the rules of the past.

3. **Claim good stuff from other cultures**

   portray really good things from other cultures as bad\
   and later reintroduce the same thing as our original.\
   reject the previous culture and its existance.\
   build and propagate false narratives to defend and cover up the stealing of culture.\
   all good stuff always belonged to us. it exists for us only.

**Conclusion:**

Its good, if you are making money out of it,\
It is called WHITEwashing for a reason,

...and thats it for now.
